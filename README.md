A short list of my configs for setting up a home media/file server


This is a documentaion project for my home server so I can have all my links and any tips ready if I need to rebuild.
I made this repo public so I can share everything for tech support and so others can use the data I collect.

# Hardware
I am running an HP EliteDesk 800 G1 SFF with ssd boot drive and i5-4590 with 16gb RAM and 1tb internal HDD
I purchased this refurb from amazon.

Hardware issues noted:
  Will not boot headless.
    Fixed by plugging a "dummy display" to the system.
  The generic laptop style dvd drive from the refurbisher will sometimes hang against the front panel on eject.
    (This is not a major issue during day to day just during setup and media ripping.)
